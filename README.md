Project: Urban Planning and Design

AI-Driven Urban Design and Planning is a groundbreaking initiative that redesigns the way cities are planned, designed, and built through artificial intelligence capabilities, spatial data processing, and Internet of Things (IoT) technology. This smart system utilizes sophisticated AI models to help develop optimal urban plans, offer real-time IoT-linked infrastructure insights, and enable safe, scalable urban planning procedures.

At its essence, the system combines spatial data analysis, GIS (Geographic Information System), and principles of architectural design to create intelligent, data-backed suggestions for urban development. The last process in the pipeline uses AI-based algorithms to suggest efficient design options, study urban behavior, and respond to changing conditions through continuous IoT-enabled monitoring.

This repository consists of an extensive summary of the finished project, including system demonstrations, extensive documentation, technical performance reports, major features of the codebase, and thorough test outcomes. Visual content in the form of architectural diagrams, GIS-integrated drawings, and annotated code excerpts is available to facilitate a better understanding of the entire potential of the system.

The AI-Powered Urban Planning and Design initiative is an innovative response for urban expansion that provides smart diagnostics and actionable intelligence to inform sustainable and smart city development.
